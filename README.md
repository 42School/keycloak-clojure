Keycloak is an open source Identity and Access Management solution aimed at modern applications and services. It makes it easy to secure applications and services with little to no code.
This repo was first an explanation of integrating Keycloak with Clojure, now I transform it to offer a library named `keycloak-clojure` to wrap the Keycloak Java Adapter and provide some utilities facilitating the integration. The initial explanation is now in the README of the `sample` directory.

Before going further be sure to read the [sample's README](sample) to understand the concepts Keycloak offers and the integration points needed to integrate it with your application backend and frontend. Of course the way Keycloak integrates with your application depends of the stack it uses.

# Backend

## Keycloak configuration

## Client ##

## Admin Usage (create Realm, Client, Role, User, etc.) 

## Sample integration with Yada
